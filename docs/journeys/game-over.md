2. **Options in Game Over Modal**:
   - Click **RESTART** to play another round.
   - Click **EXIT** to simulate closing the app (a goodbye message will be displayed).
3. **Restart or Exit**: 
   - Upon RESTART, the game board resets and a new game starts.
   - Upon EXIT, the app displays a goodbye message.
