# Playing a Game Journey

This journey describes how to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against a simple AI.

1. **Game Interface**: After clicking PLAY, the Tic Tac Toe board (a 3Ã—3 grid) is displayed.
2. **Your Move**: Click on any empty cell to place your mark ("X").
3. **AI Response**: After your move, the AI automatically makes its move ("O") after a short delay.
4. **Win Condition Check**: The game checks for a win condition (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw.
5. **Game End**: If you win or the game ends in a draw, you will be returned to the start modal. If the AI wins, a game over modal will appear.
